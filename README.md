The Single-Variable Optimization Method Manager is a specialized repository dedicated to the management and execution of optimization methods for functions with a single variable. 


# Methods 
Single-variable optimization methods often vary; some, such as those used for function search, do not require derivatives, while others, like Newton's method, necessitate the second partial derivative of the function.

# Golden Section

A method for finding the minimum of a strictly quasiconvex function f over an interval [a1, b1]


# Fibonacci

This process is based on the Fibonacci sequence {Fr}∞r=0: F0=F1=1, Fr+1=Fr+Fr−1, r=1,2,3,..
Exactly like the previous one this is used for for finding the minimum of a strictly quasiconvex function f over an interval [a1, b1]
# Bisection
Bisection search process to minimize a pseudoconvex function over an interval [a1, b1], For this, it is necessary for the function to have a well-defined first derivative over the interval [a1, b1].
the function 

# Newton
Method to find the minimum of any function f: R → R, provided that it is C2 (twice continuously differentiable).
